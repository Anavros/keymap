Pinky to any index is best.
Pinky to middle is ok.
Not pinky to ring.
Long chains work best when moving pinky to index
to the other index then other pinky.

Best movement from ring finger is middle.
Non-stretching index positions are ok.
Stretches pull the ring finger out of place.
Ring to pinky or back is never good.
In particular, central ring to upper middle is one
of the best movements on the keyboard.
Actually, ring to central index stretch is pretty
good.

Central middle finger moves to either central
index or central ring easily.
Upper middle moves to central or upper index.

Central index moves to any ring or pinky position.
Upper index prefers more upper positions using any
finger.
All stretch keys in the true center should be
matched with pinkies. Ring fingers are passable.
Tucked index positions match wonderfully with
center middle. Upper middle is good too.

General Notes:
- Pinky fingers are not very strong.
- Whatever finger gets 'e' is going to be overworked.

Layout Notes:
'g' is in a weird spot regarding 'ing'
    - Also not very good for 'ngth'
curly brackets would mabye be better fit for where the <> are in qwerty
! comes with = a lot but is really far away
